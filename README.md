# Python Screening Task 2 — AI Debugging Assistant Prompt

## Files
- `prompt.md` — the AI prompt for the debugging assistant.
- `reasoning.md` — explanation of design choices and required reasoning answers.

## How to Use
1. Load `prompt.md` as the instruction/system prompt in any LLM.  
2. Provide the student’s buggy code, error message, sample input, and expected output.  
3. The AI assistant will then follow the structured debugging process:
   - Ask for missing details.
   - Diagnose likely causes.
   - Give targeted hints (not the full solution).
   - Suggest tests.
   - Explain the underlying concept.
   - Offer progressive help (more hints or full solution only if requested).
